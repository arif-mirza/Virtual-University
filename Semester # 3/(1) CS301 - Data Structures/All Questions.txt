Lecture No. 15
Summary
• Level-order Traversal of a Binary Tree 
• Storing Other Types of Data in Binary Tree 
• Binary Search Tree (BST) with Strings 
• Deleting a Node From BST 

Level-order tranversal means we are visting the every node in the BST one by one and display its value on the screen.

Lecture No. 16
Summary 
• Deleting a node in BST 
• C++ code for remove 
• Binary Search Tree Class (BST)
