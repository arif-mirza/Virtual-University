INTEL IAPX88 ARCHITECTURE => 

i68088 ka name dete hen.
iAPX88 stands for “Intel Advanced Processor Extensions 88.” 
8088 is a 16 bit processor with accumulator and all registers of 16 bits.

1.6. REGISTER ARCHITECTURE 

•The iAPX88 architecture consists of 14 registers.
•DX = destination
•CX = counter, automatic count
•BX = base, memory addressing
•AX = Accumulator

Q#1 ) what is Index Registers (SI and DI) ?
Q#2 ) what is Instruction Pointer (IP) ?
Ans)  This is the special register containing the address of the next instruction to 
be executed.

Q#3 ) what is Stack Pointer (SP)?
Ans) It is a memory pointer and is used indirectly by a set of instructions.

Q#4 ) what is Base Pointer (BP)?
Ans) It is also a memory pointer containing the address in a special area of 
memory called the stack

Q#5 ) write down all the flag registers?
 C carry 
 P parity
 A Auxiliary

Q#6 ) how to write our first program?
move 5 to ax 
move 10 to bx 
add bx to ax 
move 15 to bx 
add bx to ax 

Q#7 ) What is Assembler, Linker, and Debugger?
Q#8) what are BX, BP, SI and DI?
Q#9) what is the importance of square brackets around the  value?
Q#10) what is JNZ? agar zaro a jaye tu jamp kar jao aur agar zero na aye tu jump nai karna
