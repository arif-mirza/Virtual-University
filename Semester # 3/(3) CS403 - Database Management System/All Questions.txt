what is dependencies and write the types also?
ans) The Existence dependency: Entities ko ak  dosre k liye exsit karna
Identifier Dependency: jo entity depent kar rahi hoti hy us ko find karne k liye 
Referential Dependency: foreign key like

===================Lecture No. 11===================

Overview of Lecture 
o Inheritance 
o Super type 
o Subtypes 
o Constraints 
o Completeness 
o Disjointness 
o Subtype Discrimination 


what is Inheritance? 
what is  Super type ? super type kahte hen parent ko aur subtype kahte hen child table ko 

what is  Subtypes ? Subtypes hold all the properties of their corresponding super-types. Means all those subtypes which are connected to a specific supertype will have all the properties of their supertype. 

what is Specifying Constraints ? write down their types?
ans) Total Completeness: super type k all attributes subtype k andar hona 
Partial Completeness Constraint: super type k sare k sare attribue subtype ko mujood na ho tu partial

what is Disjointness Constraint ? supertype ak time me ak hi subtype ko follow kar rhi 
what is Overlap Rule? supertype ak time me ak se zyda bhi subtype ko share kar rha hota hy attributes

what is Subtype Discriminator ?
This is a tool or a technique which provides us a methodology to determine that to which subtype one instance of a supertype belongs.

1- what is level 0 Diagram? also write down their 3 modules.

============Lecture No. 13===================

Summary 
sample of database and write how can we create table in the database and how can we understand the relationships amoung them.

===================Lecture No. 14===================

RDM all information like their rows, columns, inventions ,history etc.
Introduction to the Relational Data model and their 6 points


Lecture No. 15
Degree of relation => The degree of a relation is the number of columns in that relation.
Cardinality of relation => the number of rows present in a relation.
what is foreign key?
Entity Integrity Constraint: jab ap apne table k ander primary key par constraint lagate ho
how to convert conceptional db to logical db?


Lecture No. 16
Nothing important things.

Lecture No. 17
Five basic operators of rational algebra => It consists of a set of operations 
that take one or two relations as input and produce a new relation as their result.
its has two types 
unary operations => jis k ander hame apna operation perform karne k liye ak table ki zarorat hoti hy
Binaary Operations => jis k ander hame apna operation perform karne k liye two table ki zarorat hoti hy
Project Opertaors => rows sari select karni hon aur columns kosh select karne hon


Lecture No. 18
joints (Sari ki sari rows ko dosre table ki sari ki sari rows se multiply karna).
type of joints (5)
