r is called radial distance which between the o between P.
0 are called the polar angle.
p(r,0) = (x,y) same this.

smooth functions : 
r(t) is called the smooth function if there compoenets (x,y) of r have continuous derivative w.r.t  t. and r'(t) != 0.
=> properties of derivatives

arc length formula
example find the arc length Given : x,y,z(optional)

how to find parametric equations?
method :
1-  convert into du
2- taking derivatives 
3- arc length find karni hy
4- arc length me se jo s ki value aye gi us se t nikalna hy.
5- then put the inital values of t.

lectrue # 30 (Exact Differential)
exact deferrials : agar dono ka derivative lene se answers same ata hy yu exact derivative hy 
example 9P/ 9y = 8x  |   9Q/9x = 8x

means k exact derivative hy aur p k sath w.r.t y karte hen aur Q ka sath w.r.t x karte hen

integration case me ham integration lete hen bas is me ak extra chez add karte hen k p wali function me F(y) add kare ge aur F(X) Q wale function me add kare ge

questions types :
1- find the area of triangle : 
 	1- find the slopes first.
	2- find the slope by using this formula m=slope of OA
	3- equation of triangle y-y1 = m(x-x1) of OA and find other remaining two.
	4- then find the area of cloed slope by using this formula -\ydy


2- line integeral 
lim and simition mil kar integral bana dete hen

Lectrue # 31 (Line integral)

example types questions : 
Given : 
one integral
2 points A(0,2) B(2,3)
steps of solution :
1- seperate the P and Q
2- puting the value of y in P which is given in question
3-simply 

=> properties of integrals

Lectrue # 32 (Line integral - Examples)

 question type given : closed integral and three points (0,2), (0,2), (0,2), 
we find the limits by using the points which is given.

=> line integral w.r.t. arc length
1 formula is need to remember. ds/dt
=> parametric equations:-
1 formula is need to remember. ds/dt

Lectrue # 33 (Line integral - Examples)

1- exact differentials
 	to solvve P = Q = R;
	for find the integral we pluse the p, Q, R after differials
2- greems thoerm
 if exact differential na hi tu ham greem thorem apply krte he
formula of greem thorem yad krna hy

dx,dy mil kr area bnate hen
Given : elipse equation
